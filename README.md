# Stat Tracker App

This is a current **work in progress**.

## App Function
Input a players name, position, stat-value, and stat type.  Then display it on screen sorted in order of stat leaders.

## Purpose
The purpose in building this app is for me to work with vanilla Javascript.  Focusing on inputing data, storing data in local storage, displaying data, and updating data.

## Current Status
Most simple UI, two values entered.  Submiting, storing, and displaying.  

Working on logic to determine which behavior the app takes: adding a new player, or updating an existing one.
(I'm trying to do this without an edit button)

## Future Design Goals
Currently I'm working only in football statistics.  Future features will include more sports: Basketball, Baseball, Golf.

Once funcionality is resolved, more stat types will be added.
