# Stat Tracker App

This is a current **work in progress**.

update --12/16/21
[Working Page](https://stat-tracker-app.vercel.app/)

## App Function
Input a players name, position, stat-value, and stat type.  Then display it on screen sorted in order of stat leaders.

## Purpose
The purpose in building this app is for me to work with vanilla Javascript.  Focusing on inputing data, storing data in local storage, displaying data, and updating data.

## Current Status
Most simple UI, two values entered.  Submiting, storing, and displaying.  

- Can input a new name and have it added to DOM & Storage

- Can input a name already existing and update DOM & Storage

### Next Steps
Add position and stat-type (ex: yds) to input
Have position and stat-type displayed
Add receiving and defensive catagories.

## Future Design Goals
Currently I'm working only in football statistics.  Future features will include more sports: Basketball, Baseball, Golf.

Once funcionality is resolved, more stat types will be added.
